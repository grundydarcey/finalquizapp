Quiz App Project

This is my quiz app project where I have worked with DOM manipulation to create an interactive quiz. 

This quiz app begins with an introduction page to the quiz describing what it's about and offers a button for the user to begin the quiz. This will take the user to the first question that is stored in my store object at the top of my app.js file. These individual page questions not only show the question and answer options, but also shows the progress through the quiz as well as the number of questions answered correctly at that point. When the user picks an answer, they are greeted by a page informing them they answered correctly or incorrectly and a button to proceed to the next question. Once the user has made their way through the quiz, the final page will show their total progress and a button to return to the start of the quiz.
